When i code, I always have to remember a lot of different statements, and it's really time-consuming and tiring. Especially when you are working with a new PC.
That's why I created the `bb`

## Usage is simple:
### NEED FOR DEPLOY WITH DOCKER
    bb start

This command will auto install:
* git
* docker
* docker-compose


## I'm still trying to supplement and perfect `bb`
 If you are interested, please build it with me
